title: Director of Platform & Infrastructure @Remote
description:
  - Now leading multiple teams and respective team leaders, including SRE, Developer Experience and Identity and Access Management, the latter two being Product Teams. Leading 3 Staff Engineers directly, driving cross-org projects and change.
  - Previously, as a Director of Site Reliability Engineering, I managed and hired for the SRE team and participated in many cross-organizational projects which touched many topics such as software architecture, Security, automation of business processes, IT architecture, etc. Under my leadership, the SRE team successfully delivered many complex projects, the bigger of which was a complete migration of Remoteâ€™s production infrastructure to a different AWS region with minimal downtime.
  - I was also Director of Security on an interim basis for 1 year between April 2023 and March 2024. Hired 2 new individual contributors, transfered an internal hire and hired the next Director of Security. Under my leadership, the team implemented a completely new company-wide Security Awareness Training program, achieved re-certification in SOC 2 Type II, maintained ISO 27001 compliance and automated compliance processes. Particularly proud of having personally rolled out an access gate system, which prevents access to sensitive applications by employees who have not or have lapsed their security training and policy readings.
